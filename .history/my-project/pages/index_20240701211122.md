<Details title='Intro '>
  A service that facilitates uniform interaction for users with agents and LLMS across the real estate sector.

  Content Service:

  This service fetchs documents by entering user ID. When we request documents, it sends back a list of pages from a specific document called "21-12_JTS_Prolonged_Casualty_Care_Guidelines".
  
Each page has a link that you can click to view it. This helps to easily access important documents you need, making it straightforward to find and use information in the real estate field.

Rating Service:

This service allows users to rate their service experience. By sending a request with their user ID, rating, and comment, users can provide feedback. 

This confirms receipt with a message including the date and time of the rating.

Agent Interaction:
