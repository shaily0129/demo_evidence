</Details>

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Content Service">

This service fetchs documents by entering user ID. When user request documents, it sends back a list of pages from a specific document called [Prolonged_Casualty_Care_Guidelines](/static/21-12_JTS_Prolonged_Casualty_Care_Guidelines.pdf)

Each page has a link that you can click to view it. This helps to easily access important documents you need, making it straightforward to find and use information in the real estate field.

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Rating Service">

    This service allows users to rate their service experience. By sending a request with their user ID, rating, and comment, users can provide feedback.

This confirms receipt with a <b>message</b> including the date and time of the rating. 

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Agent Interaction">

    This service allows users to submit messages or questions, which are then classified into different categories such as <b>"triage"</b> for medical emergencies, <b>"evacuation planning"</b> for disaster scenarios, <b>"greetings"</b> for social interactions, and <b>"other"</b> for general queries.

Depending on the category, messages classified under `greetings` or `other` are handled by a generic agent utilizing _LLM_ tools to provide knowledge-based or generic responses. For messages related to `evacuation plans` or `medical` issues, they are routed to a Prediction Guard agent. This agent accesses data from a _RAG_(Retrieve, Augment, Generate) model that has pre-fetched knowledge. It offers detailed steps and even provides the relevant page numbers from the casualty care guideline PDF, ensuring users receive accurate and actionable information in critical situations.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Holiday Booking Service">

This service helps you book a holiday by entering your age, name, and country. If you're aged 50 or older, you can also specify your insurance preference. After you submit these details, it confirms your booking and provides a unique booking ID for your holiday reservation.
