<Details title='Intro '>
  A service that facilitates uniform interaction for users with agents and LLMS across the real estate sector.

</Details>

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Content Service">

This service fetchs documents by entering user ID. When user request documents, it sends back a list of pages from a specific document called [Prolonged_Casualty_Care_Guidelines](/static/21-12_JTS_Prolonged_Casualty_Care_Guidelines.pdf)

Each page has a link that you can click to view it. This helps to easily access important documents you need, making it straightforward to find and use information in the real estate field.

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Rating Service">

    This service allows users to rate their service experience. By sending a request with their user ID, rating, and comment, users can provide feedback.

This confirms receipt with a <b>message</b> including the date and time of the rating. 

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Agent Interaction">

    This service allows users to submit messages or questions, which are then classified into different categories such as <b>"triage"</b> for medical emergencies, <b>"evacuation planning"</b> for disaster scenarios, <b>"greetings"</b> for social interactions, and <b>"other"</b> for general queries.

Depending on the category, messages classified under `greetings` or `other` are handled by a generic agent utilizing _LLM_ tools to provide knowledge-based or generic responses. For messages related to `evacuation plans` or `medical` issues, they are routed to a Prediction Guard agent. This agent accesses data from a _RAG_(Retrieve, Augment, Generate) model that has pre-fetched knowledge. It offers detailed steps and even provides the relevant page numbers from the casualty care guideline PDF, ensuring users receive accurate and actionable information in critical situations.
